Scenario 1 (Control): 		Spawning cubes with rigidbodies in a random location in a sphere and letting them drop.
Scenario 2 (Controlled Chaos): 	Spawning cubes and spheres inside of a box all with rigidbodies and gravity applied. The gravity is strong and rotates counter clockwise. All objects will collide with each other and tumble.	
Scenario 3 (Pure chaos): 	Spawning spheres with rigidbodies and a random velocity in a random direction and let these bounce around. 

For all these tests we will be measuring the fps over 30 seconds, increasing the amound of objects with every test.
All tests will also be executed with and without the camera pointing at the objects in question.

This test will be done in both Unity and Unreal Engine 5.

All of these tests are to measure which engine handles physics better and the effect of rendering on the fps.
